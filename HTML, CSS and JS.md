# HTML, CSS and JS

This document is about the three fundamental technologies used in web development - HTML, CSS, and JS.

## HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML defines the structure and content of a web page using various elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS enables developers to separate the presentation of a document from its content, making it easier to maintain and update the design of a website.

## JS

JS stands for JavaScript, and it is a high-level programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web pages. JS enables developers to add interactivity, animations, and other advanced features to their websites.

In summary, HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS defines its presentation and layout, and JS adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to it. Understanding these three technologies is essential for any web developer.
